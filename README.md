# Deep Learning Specialization

https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

This repo contains all my work. This repo is used to keep files safe in case of a wild 'rm -rf' appears.

Quiz are not included beacuse i cant afford the course. In the future i will buy certified version of course.
